# Image Using SketchPy

This project uses the **SketchPy** Python library to generate art and sketches from images. It can draw built-in celebrity portraits or convert your own images into line-art sketches.



## Features
- Draw pre-built portraits like Robert Downey Jr., APJ Abdul Kalam, and more.
- Convert your own custom images (e.g., photos or line art) into a sketch.
- Uses Python's turtle graphics module to draw the output.

## Installation
1.  **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.9â€“3.10 is recommended for best compatibility with SketchPy).
2.  **Libraries:** Install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install sketchpy opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

### To draw a built-in portrait:
Run the `main.py` script. By default, it's set to draw Robert Downey Jr.
```bash
python main.py
